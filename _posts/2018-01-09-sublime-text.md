#### ConvertToUTF8 && Codecs33
Best plugins to solve the Chinese random character issues. Some uses GBK Encoding Support, which also does the job the Codecs33 is the root of it.

I don't have the problem of typing in Chinese characters, maybe I had a work-around before but can't remember it now. Haven't tried other languages but should be pretty similar and I think Sublime Text comes with a lot of language supports.
