title: Vim Accumulated Tips

##### Some command mode tips to better focus fingers on the keyboard.
When there is a physical keyboard around, I prefer to use ```ESC``` to get out of insert mode. However, the new Macbook Pro adopts a touchbar with ```ESC``` in it and it is not fun to use under any circumstance. Luckily, it turns out that savior to this tragedy is another combination with one extra keystroke. Believe me, it is definitely worth it for the adaptation curve. 
~~~ shell
control + [ # faster way to exit insert mode

# not prefered but still works
control + c # force quit all commands including buffered
~~~
##### Search and replace text in selection
For example there is a line
~~~
music amuse fuse refuse
~~~
To replace ```us``` with ```az```, the command would be 
~~~ SHELL
:s/\%Vus/az/g
~~~
The ```\%V``` specifies to search and replace in visual mode not entire file.
