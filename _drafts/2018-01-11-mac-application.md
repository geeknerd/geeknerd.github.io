title: Incomplete List of Softwares Recommended on Mac OS
excerpt: "I tend to re-install my system on a regular basis, and honestly I don't know why. Most of the time I'm just hoping it'll clean up the system garbage and run faster. Anyway, to keep a good track of the useful softwares on a Mac here is a list for them. Also includes some tips for MacOS that I found quite useful."

#### [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3)
As always, definitely a must have text editor for Mac system. However, vim, emacs, TextMate are also great alternatives, especially TextMate, I've been using that a lot before until I found Sublime Text 3 to be more efficient for certain jobs. 

There is another post for the packages for Sublime Text 3, might migrate that later with this one. 

#### [iStat Menus](https://bjango.com/mac/istatmenus/)
Sleek app that shows the status of the system on the menu bar of your system. If the screen is not big enough, don't put too much information on the menu bar, instead put them in the drop-down menu. A easier way to see how much resources are left, especially for those with limited hard drive space. 

#### Parallels Desktop
I've tried a few virtual machine on Mac and Parallels is by far the best in my opinion. There are different settings for different user scenarios and overall the performance is great compared with other non-paid softwares. 

#### Damaged .app
Starting from Sierra Apple has hidden the option in Security & Privacy to allow apps from anywhere by default. Just run this command in terminal and it should be back again. ```sudo spctl --master-disable```

#### Show/Hide Hidden Files

#### [PopClip](http://pilotmoon.com/popclip/)
Instantly copy/paste from a pop-up window. However, it is way powerful than that. With all these extentions to be added onto the little bar above your text, you can see the improvement in your efficiency. Try it and you'll love it. Must have for me. 

#### [Cardhop](https://flexibits.com/cardhop)
Actually just found this sleek app while searching for new interesting extentions for PopClip. Wow! I should've installed it much much much earlier. This is like the perfect alternatives or add-on to the Mac Contacts app and believe it or not, you will get the AI feel while using this app.
