### Probability Theory
**Sum rule:** $$p(X)=\sum\limits_{Y} p(X,Y)$$  
**Product rule:**Â $$p(X,Y)=p(Y|X)p(X)$$  
**Symmetry property:** $$p(X,Y)=p(Y,X)$$  
**Normalization constant:** a constant to bring integral of a non-negative function to 1, e.g. to make it a probability density function.  
**Bayes' Rule:** $$p(Y|X)=\frac{p(X|Y)p(Y)}{p(X)}$$  
$$p(Y|X)$$: Posterior Probability. 
$$p(Y)$$: Prior Probability.  
$$p(X|Y)$$: Likelihood.  
$$p(X)$$: Evidence. Also the **normalization constant**: sum of the likelihood of X for each class Y.
